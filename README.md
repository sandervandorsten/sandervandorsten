### Hi there, I'm Sander van Dorsten 👋

🇳🇱 I'm a Data Engineer from the Netherlands, and live in Utrecht.

🏫 I have a background in Data Science and Machine Learning, and love to apply Software Engineering best practices into projects.

🔭 I'm currently  creating Data platforms according to Data Lakehouse architecture in both Azure and AWS. I'm incorporating a plethora of software tools to do so.

🌱 I'm currently learning more about Terraform (tool) and the position of Analytics Engineering in the Modern Data Stack. You may find me at meetups like  [PyData](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-nl/), the [Digital Power Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/digital-power-data-tips-know-how/), the [Analytics Engineering](https://www.meetup.com/analytics-engineering/) sessions or at [Data Engineering NL](https://www.meetup.com/data-engineering-nl/).

🧗 In my free time I go bouldering in the gym in Utrecht. A couple of times a year I go to Fontainebleau to enjoy climbing outdoors 🏕️🌲🪨
