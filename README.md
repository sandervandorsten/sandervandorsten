### Hi there, I'm Sander van Dorsten 👋

🇳🇱 I'm a Machine Learning / Data Engineer from the Netherlands, and live in Utrecht.

🏫 I have a background in Data Science and Machine Learning, and love to apply Software Engineering best practices into projects.

🔭 I'm currently creating Machine Learning Operations tools For Schiphol Group. 

🌱 I'm currently learning more about setting up Databricks for enterprises, and studying for my Certificatied Kubernetes Administration exam (CKA).  

📅 You may find me at meetups like [PyData](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-nl/), the [Data & Drinks Meetup of Xomnia](https://www.meetup.com/data-drinks/) or at the [MLOps Community in Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-mlops-community/).

🧗 In my free time I go bouldering in the gym in Utrecht. A couple of times a year I go to Fontainebleau to enjoy climbing outdoors 🏕️🌲🪨
